Once your app has enabled the push notifications, you can use the APIs to register user devices such as iPhones and Android phones.

> [!NOTE]
> Each chat user has a limit of  **25**  unique devices. Once this limit is reached, the oldest device will be removed and replaced by the new device.

### Register a Device

Registering a device associates it with a user and tells the push provider to send new message notifications to the device.

> [!NOTE]
> Register the user's device for remote push notifications once your user is successfully connected to Chat.


> [!NOTE]
> Multi-bundle configurations require that you specify a push_provider_name when registering a device that corresponds to the name of the push configuration that you've set up in the dashboard or via the API.


```python
client.add_device(
  '2ffca4ad6599adc9b5202d15a5286d33c19547d472cd09de44219cda5ac30207',
  'apn',
  '42'
)
```

### Unregister a Device

Unregistering a device removes the device from the user and stops further new message notifications.

```python
client.delete_device(
  '2ffca4ad6599adc9b5202d15a5286d33c19547d472cd09de44219cda5ac30207',
