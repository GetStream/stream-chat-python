The `queryMembers` method allows you to list and paginate members for a channel. It supports filtering on numerous criteria to efficiently return member information. This is useful for channels with large member lists where you need to search for specific members or display the complete member roster.

```python
# Query members by user name
response = channel.query_members(
  filter_conditions={"name": "tommaso"},
  sort=[{"field": "created_at", "direction": 1}],
)

# Autocomplete members by user name
response = channel.query_members(filter_conditions={"name": {"$autocomplete": "tom"}})

# Query all members
response = channel.query_members(filter_conditions={})
```

You can also filter by any field available in the custom data.

## Paginating Channel Members

By default, members are ordered from oldest to newest. You can paginate results using offset-based pagination or by the `created_at` or `user_id` fields.

Offset-based pagination is the simplest to implement, but it can lead to incorrect results if the member list changes while you are paginating. The recommended approach is to sort by `created_at` or `user_id`.

```python
# Paginate by user_id in descending order
response = channel.query_members(
  filter_conditions={},
  sort=[{"field": "user_id", "direction": 1}],
  offset=0,
  limit=10,
)

# Paginate by created_at in ascending order
response = channel.query_members(
  filter_conditions={},
  sort=[{"field": "created_at", "direction": -1}],
  offset=0,
  limit=10,
)
```
